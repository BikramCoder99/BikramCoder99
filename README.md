# 💫 About Me:
I am a Big Data Engineer and System Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) with 4.7+ years of hands-on industry experience in designing, building, and optimizing scalable data engineering solutions on the Azure cloud platform. My work focuses on delivering reliable, high-performance data pipelines that enable data-driven decision-making and enterprise analytics.<br><br>My core expertise lies in Big Data and cloud-based ETL engineering, where I work extensively with Apache Spark, Azure Databricks, Azure Data Factory, and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2) to process large-scale structured and semi-structured datasets. I have successfully executed end-to-end data migrations from Mainframe and Teradata to Azure, ensuring data accuracy, lineage, and quality compliance.<br><br>I am highly proficient in PySpark, Python, Spark SQL, SQL, Scala, and distributed data processing frameworks. My experience includes developing reusable SQL stored procedures, JSON-based curation frameworks, and PySpark applications for data cleansing, validation, transformation, aggregation, and partitioning. I have automated complete ETL lifecycles using parameterized ADF pipelines, triggers, and Databricks notebook orchestration, improving pipeline reliability and reducing operational overhead.<br><br>Across projects such as Trade Price & Promotion Management (TPM), Data Enablement, and Pharmacy Data Analysis, I have collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to deliver business-ready datasets, optimize pipeline performance, and reduce project costs by approximately 20% through efficient design and automation. I also have experience managing CI/CD deployments using Azure DevOps and following Agile delivery practices.<br><br>In addition to my technical strengths, I bring strong problem-solving abilities, system design understanding, and DSA fundamentals, enabling me to build maintainable, scalable, and future-ready data platforms. I hold a Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering with a strong academic record and multiple industry-recognized certifications, including Microsoft Azure Data Engineer Associate and Databricks Certified Data Engineer Associate.<br><br>I am passionate about continuous learning, performance optimization, and building robust data ecosystems that bridge raw data with meaningful insights in cloud-enabled, data-driven environments.
